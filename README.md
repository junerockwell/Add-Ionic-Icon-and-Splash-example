# Add Ionic Icon and Splash images example
An Ionic example app that demonstrates how to add icons and splash images manually as a fallback. 

This project is based on Blank template by Ionic.

#### Purpose
1. Just an actual example of this tutorial. (Please refer to this tutorial for more information regarding this example).
2. This is just a fallback in case the Ionic CLI will still be in beta and can't generate the icon and splash images correctly or at all.
3. To provide Illustrator templates ready with file names and artboard sizes in the hopes of easy **Save for Web..**. Just change the artwork and add your own, if you want to use the templates.
